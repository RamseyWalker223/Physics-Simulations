>Started setting up my project, I made a Cmake list, and added my dependacies.

**Wed Oct 29 2025**
> - Added dependancies like glfw and glew into the dependancies folder and then set up a build system with Cmake so I can easily build my project. 
>- Abstracted all of the OpenGL functions into classes for the project.
>- Finally got it to show a triangle on the screen
>- Got a working circle class, that takes in a position and radius. Then added a render function, that will draw it to the screen.
